# For The Win Gaming League

Is an online gaming league app that is geared towards managing tournaments for the amateur online gamer.
While the professional scene has exploded in terms of E-sports, everyday
gamers have been forgotten and relegated to boring and inactive ladders.

FTW boasts a Season format, similar to any real life professional sport league. Win multiple
scheduled games in a season, then you will face off against the best in a
playoff.
